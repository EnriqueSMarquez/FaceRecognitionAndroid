# FaceRecognitionAndroid
Facial Recognition for android phones. It was developed on Android Studio.

It generates an app (.apk) that allows the user to create a database by adding new people. This database stores the facial biometric of the person (It extracts the biggest face in the image, the faces are detected through Viola Jones). 

Matching Biometrics:
Giving a test face it can either perform SIFT matching with all the people in the database, or finds the closest point in the space. This point (sparse vector) is generated by using Vector Quantization methodology with a set of pre-calculated centroids.

It still has some flaws. Like the centroids should be stored in the cache, instead they are calculated every time a matching is performed.
